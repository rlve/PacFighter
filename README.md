# PacFighter 
It's a little variation of PacMan game. 

The goal is to collect all Gems placed on the map. Speed of ghosts increases with amount of collected gems.

Player have three lives and possibility to kill one of ghosts. To be able to do that, a sword has to be collected! Unfortunately the sword is destroyed after first successful killing.

To control Pac use keyboard arrows.

Movement of ghosts based on scirpts from:

Good luck and have fun.
